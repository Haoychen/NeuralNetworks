        Parameters
    ---------------
    c: np.ndarray
        a n x m matrix  representing the coefficients of all the image blocks.
        n represents the maximum dimension of the PCA space.
        m is (number of images x n_blocks**2)

    D: np.ndarray
        an N x n matrix representing the basis vectors of the PCA space
        N is the dimension of the original space (number of pixels in a block)

    im_num: Integer
        index of the image to visualize

    X_mean: np.ndarray
        a matrix representing the mean block.

    num_coeffs: Integer
        an integer that specifies the number of top components to be
        considered while reconstructing

        c: np.ndarray
            a l x m matrix  representing the coefficients of all blocks in a particular image
            l represents the dimension of the PCA space used for reconstruction
            m represents the number of blocks in an image

        D: np.ndarray
